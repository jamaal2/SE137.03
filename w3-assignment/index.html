        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>hello, I am Jamaal and some things that I like and enjoy doing are playing video games, talking to my friends, and listening to music is my favorite out of all. My favorite artist is Lil Uzi Vert, and I've been listening to him for a very long time. I listen to all types of music, but I mainly listen to hip-hop, rap, and R&B. My favorite types of video games are single player games like Spiderman, Uncharted, Hitman, and The Last of Us.</p>
